## üíß Repository Update

* If you have updated the offsets, and want to share it with everyone follow this  steps

1. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/IMXNOOBX/cs2-external-esp/pulls) and provided just the `offsets/offsets.json` updated file in the pull request. if there are any other files modified it will be denied

2. Provide a valid image that the esp is working on the latest version on the game

3. The commit will be merged into the main branch once verified and all the users will be able to update it!

## ‚úî Manually Update

* To manually update the esp offsets i have included an offsets.json file which will be created once opened.

1. Two ways to get the latest offsets.
1.1 Go to this [unknowncheats thread](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counter-strike-2-a/576077-counter-strike-2-reversal-structs-offsets.html) and find the latest offsets posted by the community
1.2 Or go to this repository [cs2-dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper) and find the latest offstes

2. You will find somethig like this

```cpp
#define dwLocalPlayer 0x1715418 // This is hexadecimal
```

3. You will have to translate it to decimal and put it in the offsets file next to the esp executable like so, you can use [**this website**](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html)

```json
{
    "dwLocalPlayer": 24204312, // To decimal
    ...
}	
```

## üìò Developer Instructions

1. Build the program using **Visual Studio 2022**
