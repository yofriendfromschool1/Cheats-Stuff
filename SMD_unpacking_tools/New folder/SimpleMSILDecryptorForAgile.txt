SimpleMSILDecryptorForAgile:
this tool decrypts methods of last version of Agile;
inspirated by duyan13 https://board.b-at-s.info/index.php?showtopic=9313

Two Frameworks are supported: Framework 2.0 and Framework 4.0;
Framework 4+ (latter Frameworks like 4.6.1 etc.) should be suported
by Framework 4.0:
Place Simple_MSIL_Decryptor.exe.config, SJITHook.dll and Simple_MSIL_Decryptor.exe
in the target program directory; start Simple_MSIL_Decryptor.exe
from NetBox 4.0 and try to decrypt target assembly;
if reports missing assemblies you should place them in the target
directory for beeing able to decrypt MSIL of those methods;
in the end undecrypted count should be 0.


Next step: unvirtualize Agile with de4dot:
This may not work for some targets!
After we decrypt MSIL we deobfuscate methods with de4dot v3.1.41592,
we just set decrypts methods to false so de4dot won't decrypt methods
by adding to de4dot.exe the parameter:
--an-methods false

in command line do:
de4dot.exe filename.exe --an-methods false
