This SMD from codecrackers for unpacking VMProtect(all versions). I found 2 versions, 1  i modify (It doesn't always work)
Try all three versions, should jithook on pure managed code, !!!without mixed!!!
To work, rename the file to "Simple_MSIL_Decryptor.exe"
WARNING: start on Win7 x64 v6.1 build 7601 SP1 in netbox 4.0, on win10 don't work
