## Rules and Requirement:
#### Rules:
1. Patch? Here's a deal: 
- No patching if you're unpacked UPX, as final result! 
- Allowed patching if you're not unpacked UPX, as final result! 
- only patch-fix the flaw like missing stdc dll, or temporary byte patch to making loader or hook
2. Spoiling? No! (a lot of pro cracker split the answer on comment...)
3. Keygen? useless. Because the goal is bypass it!
4. Hooking? Allowed! It's not a patch!
5. Loader? Allowed! It's just a mem patch, not file patch...
6. Any these above, do not use any tool to create stuff like Baymax or dUP2, but you can create your own one with coding.

#### Requirement:
- Assembly/C++ skill
- Any debugger you love! (__x32dbg__, OllyDbg,...) - **Recommend!**
- Any disassembler you love! (IDA, Binary Ninja, Ghidra,...) **Recommend!**

## Credit
