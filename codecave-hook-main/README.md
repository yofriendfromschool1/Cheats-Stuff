codecave hook reverse engineering toolkit.

**codecave hook is a reverse engineering toolkit i made to make my life easier which soon expanded into full blown bypasses of loaders.**

**Built in DLL dumper** 

**Built in Driver Dumper**

**Built In Debugger hooking and bypass**

**Built in Process Searching Bypass**

**Built in KeyAuth Download Finder**

**Built in Curl Detection**

**Built in Command Dumper for CMD and CreateProcess**

**Built in Process Hollowing Dumper (RUNPE and its other forms.)**

**Built in URLDownloadA Hook**

**Built in BlockInput Disabler**

**Built in Anti BSOD**

**Built in File Dumper**

**Memory Nop**

**Memory String Searcher**

**Memory Fill with Nops.**

**Keyauth Bypass Via nopping success method RVA**

**How?**

well codecave is mostly relient on detouring functions to do what you want, for example i hooked WriteProcessMemory to dump Process Hollowing which can also be used for dumping DLL

it relies on detour hooks, minhook whilst also being able to read and write memory.

**NOTE: You cannot use memory writing or reading after placing a detour hook, this needs to be fixed, you can simply set your memory patches before detouring.**
